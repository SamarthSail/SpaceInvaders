This project is a Java-based recreation of the classic arcade game Space Invaders. The game involves a player controlling a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen, aiming to shoot and destroy waves of descending aliens. The project is meant to demonstrate object-oriented programming principles and includes various components such as game graphics, user input handling and collision detection.

This project features/uses:
* Java AWT/Swing: For rendering graphics and handling user input.
* Threading: For smooth and responsive game updates and animations.
* Object-Oriented Design: To manage game entities like the player, aliens, and projectiles.
