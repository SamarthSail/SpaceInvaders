This project is a Java-based recreation of the classic arcade game Space Invaders. The game involves a player controlling a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen, aiming to shoot and destroy waves of descending aliens. The project emphasizes object-oriented programming principles and includes various components such as game graphics, user input handling, collision detection, and sound effects.

Technologies Used:
Java Programming Language: Core logic and game mechanics.
Java AWT/Swing: For rendering graphics and handling user input.
Threading: For smooth and responsive game updates and animations.
Object-Oriented Design: To manage game entities like the player, aliens, and projectiles.
